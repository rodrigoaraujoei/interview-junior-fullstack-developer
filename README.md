## Thoughts

I did the tasks asked for but I would like to add a bit more functionalities in the app, but since I had to work with my father this last few days I didn't had to much time, but I'm happy with what I did. I hope when u look at the code u can see someone who reads the Docs and a person who tries stuff until its working, meaning that's my best skill and someone who works with me will see that and find that useful. I hope that's enough to go to the next phase, so for now thank you for the opportunity an I'll wait for the response.
